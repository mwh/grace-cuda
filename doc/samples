These sample programs can be compiled with `make samples`:
- map performs a simple map over multiple arrays.
- generalcuda uses general CUDA code to perform multiple tasks. The
  code is written in a Grace-like syntax, but corresponds directly to
  CUDA operations.
- matrix implements a simple matrix multiplication algorithm and its
  native Grace equivalent for comparison.
- matrix2 implements the same algorithm, but using a different method
  to control the CUDA block size directly, and an even more analogous
  Grace implementation.
