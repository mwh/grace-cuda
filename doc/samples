These sample programs can be compiled with `make samples`:
- map performs a simple map over multiple arrays.
- generalcuda uses general CUDA code to perform multiple tasks. The
  code is written in a Grace-like syntax, but corresponds directly to
  CUDA operations.
- matrix implements a simple matrix multiplication algorithm and its
  native Grace equivalent for comparison. Essentially the same code is
  used for both implementations.
- matrix-infer implements the same matrix multiplication algorithm, but
  the types are inferred. The CUDA and Grace implementations have
  identical code bodies.
- matrix-flat implements the same algorithm, but with the
  using()times()do method for a "flat" loop.
