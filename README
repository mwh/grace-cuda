grace-cuda provides Grace bindings to CUDA, a GPU processing system

To compile CUDA code you will need to enable the cudap compiler plugin
using the -XPlugin=cudap option to minigrace.

cudap will need to be in the dynamic search path of minigrace -- the two
simplest locations are either the current directory or next to minigrace
itself, which is where `make install` will put it. grace-cuda also
requires a directory "_cuda" to be found in the current directory, in
which the generated CUDA kernel files will be stored.

There are some small sample programs using grace-cuda in the samples
directory. To build them all, run `make samples` and then run each as
(e.g.) `samples/matrix`. Each sample includes a brief description at the
top.

If your Minigrace or CUDA installations are different than expected you
will need to specify one or more of the variables found at the top of
the Makefile. You may also need to modify cudap.grace to set the path to
nvcc.

These bindings are intended for use with Minigrace, a compiler for
Grace. Minigrace is available from <https://github.com/mwh/minigrace>
or <http://ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/minigrace/>.
